# Education

## Master of Data Science - University of British Columbia (UBC)
I am currently pursuing my Master's in Data Science at the University of British Columbia, driven by my passion for applying data-driven solutions to real-world challenges in e-commerce, finance, and public policy. My interest in these domains stems from my background in economics and informatics, where I developed a strong foundation in statistical modeling, data analytics, and computational problem-solving.

At UBC, I have worked on various projects that involve advanced machine learning techniques, causal inference, and big data analysis. Through hands-on coursework and collaborations with peers, I have refined my skills in data engineering, statistical modeling, and software development. The program's interdisciplinary approach has further enhanced my ability to analyze complex systems and derive actionable insights from data.

### Capstone
(TBD)

## Honors Bachelor's Degree in Economics (Minor in Informatics) - University of Washington
I earned my undergraduate degree in Economics with a minor in Informatics from the University of Washington. My academic journey was shaped by a strong analytical mindset and an interest in leveraging data to drive decision-making. Studying economics provided me with a deep understanding of market behavior, optimization, and policy analysis, while my coursework in informatics allowed me to develop technical expertise in computational methods, databases, and machine learning.

This combination of quantitative and computational training has been instrumental in preparing me for a career in data science, equipping me with the ability to analyze data from both an economic and technical perspective. My undergraduate thesis focused on applying econometric techniques to real-world problems, reinforcing my ability to extract meaningful insights from data and translate them into actionable recommendations.
