ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm Yeji, a passionate data scientist with a knack for machine learning and predictive modeling. 
My repositories showcase a variety of projects, from web scraping and causal inference to Dockerfile and Github Actions practicies. 
I love exploring new technologies and applying them to solve real-world problems.

Thanks for stopping by! ðŸ˜Š
