ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm Yeji, a passionate data scientist with expertise in data analysis and reporting, query optimization, database design, and data modelling.
My repositories showcase a variety of projects, from web scraping and causal inference to Dockerfile and Github Actions practicies. 
I love exploring new technologies and applying them to solve real-world problems.
